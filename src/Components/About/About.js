                Mitchell Cole is a filmmaker from Northwest Florida, AKA "The Panhandle". His films often feature unlikely antiheroes as main protagonists, forcing audiences to question the true meaning of good and evil. He frequently collaborates with Wesley Chevillot, producer and lifelong friend. The duo produce their films under the production company, Black Bottom Studios (named for the road that they lived on as children). Mitchell has received awards from numerous film festivals in the United States and Canada. As of early 2023, he is developing his debut feature film which will be based on the play "Merchant of Venice" by William Shakespeare.
